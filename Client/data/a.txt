so I am writing a 2d platformer game on SDL3 and cpp
and has a period of colision problems - finally seem to fixed them

but only one (or maybe two - don't know if it is 1 or 2 problems) is still exists
I would be glad if you would help find it

so the case is - jump near vertical wall without horizontal movement

near - so that it collided - and if  I move horizontaly into the wall it stops bagging

bag is: enourmously big jump, like two times larger

I can provide code for you if you want
